2024-05-14T18:00:01Z,HepLean: Digitalising high energy physics,Joseph Tooby-Smith,"  We introduce HepLean, an open-source project to digitalise definitions,
theorems, proofs, and calculations in high energy physics using the interactive
theorem prover Lean 4. HepLean has the potential to benefit the high energy
physics community in four ways: making it easier to find existing results,
allowing the creation of new results using artificial intelligence and
automated methods, allowing easy review of papers for mathematical correctness,
and providing new ways to teach high energy physics. We will discuss these in
detail. We will also demonstrate the digitalisation of three areas of high
energy physics in HepLean: Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrices in flavour
physics, local anomaly cancellation, and Higgs physics.

at large momentum transfer give support in the presence of the
energy-independent part of the hadron spin flip amplitude with the momentum
dependence proposed in the works by Galynskii-Kuraev.

"
2022-04-18T19:02:21Z,"Detecting High-Energy Neutrino Minibursts from Local Supernovae with
  Multiple Neutrino Observatories","Ali Kheirandish,Kohta Murase","  Growing evidence from multi-wavelength observations of extragalactic
supernovae (SNe) has established the presence of dense circumstellar material
in Type II SNe. Interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar
material should lead to diffusive shock acceleration of cosmic rays and
associated high-energy emission. Observation of high-energy neutrinos along
with the MeV neutrinos from SNe will provide unprecedented opportunities to
understand unanswered questions in cosmic-ray and neutrino physics. We show
that current and future neutrino detectors can identify high-energy neutrinos
from an extragalactic SN in the neighborhood of the Milky Way. We present the
prospects for detecting high-energy neutrino minibursts from SNe in known local
galaxies, and demonstrate how the network of multiple high-energy neutrino
detectors will extend the horizon for the identification of high-energy SN
neutrinos. We also discuss high-energy neutrino emission from SN 2023ixf.

2015-09-24T19:18:18Z,"Radiative energy loss and radiative p_T-broadening of high-energy
  partons in QCD matter",Bin Wu,"  I give a self-contained review on radiative p_T-broadening and radiative
energy loss of high-energy partons in QCD matter. The typical p_T^2 of
high-energy partons receives a double logarithmic correction due to the
recoiling effect of medium-induced gluon radiation. Such a double logarithmic
term, averaged over the path length of the partons, can be taken as the
radiative correction to the jet quenching parameter qhat and hence contributes
to radiative energy loss. This has also been confirmed by detailed calculations
of energy loss by radiating two gluons.
